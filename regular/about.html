    <h2>hacker [n.]</h2>
    <p class="aside">[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]</p>
  </header>

  <p>A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.</p>

<p><strong>HackSoc</strong> is the University of York's Computer Science society. We run a healthy mix of academic and social events (see the calendar on the main page), including a weekly lunchtime social in the Glasshouse, the Langwith College bar. If any of our events sound interesting to you, great! Feel free to just turn up to anything that catches your eye. If you'd like regular updates on what's happening in HackSoc, don't forget to sign up to our mailing list or follow us on Facebook and Twitter!</p>

<p>Look out for our posters in the Computer Science department.</p>

<p>We're available through email, IRC, Facebook, and Twitter! We also have a mailing list which we use for announcements, such as our weekly email.</p>
